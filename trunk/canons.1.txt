CANONS (1)
=========

NAME
----
Canons - Brings Sudokus in a canonical form.

SYNOPSIS
--------
'canons' <infile >outfile

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'canons' reads Sudokus from standard input, one per line (and with a zero '0'
representing an empty cell). It prints them to standard output in the same
sequence, transformed to their canonical form. The canonical form the one
that is the lowest in lexicographic order of all the representations that can
be generated by a set of transformations that don't change the game's logic.

These transformations are: 

	- reordering of columns and rows within the same 3x3 blcok
	- reordering of columns and rows block wise
	- transposition
	- permutation (that means renumbering)

OPTIONS
-------
None

BUGS
----
canons only performs very basic input sanitations, you should not use it in a
hostile environment (e.g. web server).

canons is slow, but that seems to be due to the problem, not due to poor
programming.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
----------------------
This section is not important, you may just as well skip it. It contains some
developement informations.

'canons' is written in ansi C++. It uses no C++ features except input/output. 
A ansi C implementation  is available as well, and
probably only that version will be further developed.


The largest part of the source code is a static array of 6^4 permutations of
the number 0 ... 8, representing the transformations described in section
`DESCRIPTION`.

For each Suodku read from standard input a Sudoku is stored which is the
lexicographic least of all computed transformations so far. All of the 
6^4 * 6^4 * 2 transformations are computed, but only as far as needed to
decide whether that transformation is lexicographic smaller than the current
minimum. If it is smaller, the minimum is update to the current
transformation.

So far I haven't found a way to compute a canonical form without applying all
possible transformations.
